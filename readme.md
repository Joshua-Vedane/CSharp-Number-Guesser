# Number Guesser 
This is a simple console application built in .NET and written in C#. I created it through Visual Studio following along with the Traversy Media tutorial here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFJjpMFJvI&ab_channel=TraversyMedia . 

Once the program is running, it will open up a window in the terminal. Follow the prompts for playing the game. The program generates a random number for each iteration of the game between 1 and 10. 

## Getting Started

### Notes 
This is my first .NET/C# application. I started learning some basic C# from the Microsoft tutorials on April 1, 2020. 
I found the Traversy tutorial on April 5, 2020.
